# Deployment
I used Gitpod to develop the project. I contributed all changes to git version control, and I saved changes to GitHub using the push command in Gitpod.

## Heroku
Ensure your project has these two files before building a Heroku app: requirements.txt - This is created by pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt Procfile - This is created by echo web: python run.py > Procfile

## Setting up deployment
- DATABASE_URL must be added to settings.py temporarily:
- To migrate the database models in the project to the Postgres database, run the following command: python3 manage.py migrate
- check git.ignore if env.py is there
- If you want your Heroku app to be deployed directly from a Github repository, you can do so as follows: On the deploy tab of your Heroku app, select GitHub - Connect to GitHub. If not already logged in, sign up with GitHub. We will then prompt you to find a Github repository to connect to.

- To deploy your app to Heroku click the "Deploy Branch" button.
